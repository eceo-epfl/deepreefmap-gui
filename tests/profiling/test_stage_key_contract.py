"""`profiling/eta.py` learns and projects per-stage timings keyed by stage name;
`profiling/instrumentation.py` is what emits those durations from a run's timing
marks. The two key sets are written out independently and drift doesn't raise: a
stage the estimator knows but instrumentation never times just has no history,
so the ETA quietly degrades to weight-based projection.

Matching key sets is not enough on its own. The orchestrator names only four
stages and distinguishes everything inside "outputs" by message, so a span can be
declared, agree with eta.py, and still never be reachable because nothing emits
the mark that opens it. That is how cloud/ortho/save_view went unmeasured. These
tests pin both halves: the names agree, and every name has a live producer.
