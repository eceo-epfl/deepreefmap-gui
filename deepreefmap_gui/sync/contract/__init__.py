"""The registry's published contract artefact, and the constants derived from it.

``sync-contract.json`` is the registry's own ``contract/sync-contract.json``,
copied in whole and never edited here. Refresh it with::

    cp ../deepreefmap-api/contract/sync-contract.json deepreefmap_gui/sync/contract/

Every version number and section name this app speaks comes out of that file, so
there is one place a contract change lands and no hand-typed integer that can
drift from what the registry published.

Nothing is imported here beyond the standard library. ``sync/client.py`` depends
on this module and on nothing else in the package, which is what keeps the client
free of the survey layer.
