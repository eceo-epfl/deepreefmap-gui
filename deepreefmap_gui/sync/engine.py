"""Pull, push, and the conflict reports both produce.

Pull runs before push. It narrows the window in which this laptop is working from
a stale copy, and it means a row two people edited is discovered before the local
edit is offered rather than after it was refused.

Both halves are resumable. The pull cursor is written after each page that landed,
and a section's push watermark moves only once the registry has accounted for
every row that section sent, so an interrupted sync repeats work rather than
losing it.

No Qt here, deliberately: the surface runs this on a worker thread and marshals
the reports back through signals.
