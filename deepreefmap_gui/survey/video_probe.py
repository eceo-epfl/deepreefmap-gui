"""Read what a clip's container says about itself: when it was shot, how big, and
whether the camera recorded a gravity vector.

Gravity is the reason this exists. The mapping backends align a reconstruction
with the ``GRAV`` stream a GoPro writes into its telemetry track, so whether a
clip carries one decides how the run comes out, and the user needs to know that
before processing rather than after. The library reads that stream through
``py_gpmf_parser``, which is published for ``linux-x86_64`` only, so asking it
would answer "no gravity" on the Windows and macOS builds regardless of the file.

An MP4 says all of it in its own index. Walking the atoms costs a handful of
seeks and about 7 KB of reads, well under a millisecond on a 2.5 GB clip, needs
no decoder and no dependency, and behaves the same on every platform.

Nothing here raises. A file that cannot be parsed reports ``readable=False`` and
says ``UNKNOWN`` rather than ``NO``: "the camera recorded no gravity" and "we
could not tell" are different facts and the interface shows them differently.
