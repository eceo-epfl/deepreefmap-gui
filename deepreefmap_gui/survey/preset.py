"""Two-layer survey settings: an organisation preset, and a per-machine override.

The organisation preset is the blessed configuration. It is read-only, carries a
name, a version and a content hash, and comes either from the bundled resource or
from an admin-provided file named by ``$DEEPREEFMAP_SURVEY_PRESET``. An admin file
is treated as authoritative: the preset it holds is locked.

The machine override is the small set of settings one laptop is allowed to differ
on. Only the keys in ``MACHINE_OVERRIDABLE_KEYS`` may be written there, so a
curious diver in advanced mode cannot permanently rebrand a field machine's
method. Everything else follows the organisation preset, and a deviation is named
to the user and recorded in the run manifest.
