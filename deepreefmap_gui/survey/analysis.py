"""Cross-run benthic cover assembly and repeatability statistics for a transect.

The defensible transect cover figure is the count-weighted pool in
:func:`pooled_transect_cover`: it sums the observed counts over the summed
denominators, so a short pass cannot swing the estimate the way an unweighted
mean of per-pass fractions does. Reruns of one pass are collapsed to the latest
succeeded run before pooling (:func:`latest_run_per_pass`) so a rerun does not
count twice. :func:`repeatability_stats` still reports the spread between
passes, but that spread is not the cover estimate.
