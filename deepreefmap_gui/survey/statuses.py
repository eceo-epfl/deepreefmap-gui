"""Every status the interface can show: its label, colour role and filter bucket.

One row per status. The store validates against it, core/widgets.py colours from
it, and the browser builds its filters from it.

Plain dataclasses rather than an enum: this package supports Python 3.10, where
a str-mixin enum formats as ``RunStatus.FAILED`` rather than as its value, and
these keys are written to the database.
