"""The readiness check, shown before planning on a machine that is not ready.

Four rows say whether this machine can process a dive: the graphics card,
memory, the models it needs, and disk space. Each failing row carries the one
action that fixes it. When they pass, the check stops leading on launch.

Memory is advisory: it fails against the session currently queued rather than
against the machine, and processing still starts.

It is the first view of the Setup destination, which is why the page is
a bare card rather than a titled one: simple/machine.py owns the heading and the
switch that reaches the other views.

The verdict functions are pure and Qt-free so the pass/fail logic is tested
without a window, the same split progress.py uses for the step badges.
