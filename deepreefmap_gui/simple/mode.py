"""The interface shell: destinations, and the shared survey store accessor.

One interface, and every panel in it is a single widget lent to the destination
that shows it: Browse into the shell, the model library and system panel into
Setup, the results panel into View mode, the run form into the settings dialog.
Two copies of any of them would disagree the moment a download or a path edit
landed against only one.

The header holds three peer destinations and no sequence: run_gate() treats a
pass with no transect as fine, so transects are not a precondition for
processing. Anything wrong with one of them is named once, in the alert box.

        corrupt file, an output root on an unplugged drive -- would otherwise
        take the whole launch down before there is anything to show the error in.
        Every caller that runs during construction goes through here.

        An open store is its own verdict, so a root that has already been opened
        is not re-inspected: refreshes arrive by the handful whenever the output
        folder changes, and the answer can only change when the root changes or
        the store is dropped, both of which clear ``_survey_store_obj``.

        A verdict of "will not open" is held on to just as firmly. Retrying it
        cannot succeed -- nothing has changed since the last attempt -- and each
        attempt logs a traceback and takes a backup, so the handful of refreshes
        becomes a flood. check_survey_database clears the verdict once recovery
        has actually altered something.
