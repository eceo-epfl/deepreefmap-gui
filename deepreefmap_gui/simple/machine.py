"""Setup: one destination for everything about the computer you are on.

Readiness, models, performance and updates are four views of one subject, so they
get one destination and a segmented control inside it rather than four header
entries competing with the work.

The header button reports the machine before it is opened, in two slots and no
more: what is stopping work, and whether an update is waiting. Its verdict comes
from machine_state() in section_state.py, which is the same Qt-free vocabulary
the destinations use and is computed from the same checks the Run gate blocks on, so
the header cannot claim the machine is fine while Process refuses to start.
