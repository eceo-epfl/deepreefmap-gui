"""The window, and the process it runs in.

`DeepReefMapWindow` builds no feature of its own. It fuses the 21 mixins listed in its bases
(the feature-to-file table is in `deepreefmap_gui/__init__.py`), owns the frame they fill in
(splitters, the view bar, the central layout, the shortcuts), and shuts everything down in
`closeEvent`. Read `__init__` in order, not in parts: the form widgets are built first because
the toolbar, the settings dialog and Setup are all wired to them, and `_activate_interface`
is last because it populates every page and re-divides the splitter.

## Signals

Every `_sig_*` is declared here rather than in the mixin that emits it, because `Signal` has to be
a class attribute of a QObject subclass and `DeepReefMapWindow` is the only one in the fusion:
`MixinBase` is `object` at runtime, and PySide6 refuses a second QObject base. The protocol in
`core/window_protocol.py` restates them so mypy can see them from a mixin, and
`tests/core/test_window_protocol_sync.py` compares the two lists.

They exist because a worker thread cannot touch a widget. The pattern is the same everywhere: a
daemon thread does the slow thing (a download in `models/cache_ui.py`, a reconstruction or a run
load in `runs/loading.py`, a batch in `simple/batch.py`, a disk walk in `runs/browse.py`, a
release check in `update/version.py`) and emits; the connection made in `__init__` below delivers
it as a queued call on the GUI thread, where the `_on_*`/`_apply_*` slot in the owning mixin runs.
`QTimer.singleShot` from a worker thread would silently do nothing, so it is never the answer.

Two signals are deliberately not connected here. `_sig_qc_render_progress` and
`_sig_qc_render_done` are connected per export in `runs/results.py`, because their slots close
over a QProgressDialog that only exists for that render; `closeEvent` disconnects them before
releasing handles so a render still in flight cannot drive a widget Qt is about to destroy.

## launch()

Order matters more than the code suggests. The Wayland/OpenGL environment variables and the
`QSurfaceFormat` have to be set before the QApplication exists (VTK 9 needs a 3.2 core profile,
and macOS exposes nothing above 2.1 any other way), fonts and theme before the window, and the
SIGINT heartbeat after it, so Ctrl-C reaches the interpreter while `exec()` blocks in C++.
