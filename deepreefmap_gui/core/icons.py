"""The icon set: Lucide glyphs, rendered to DPI-aware QIcons.

The glyphs are Lucide (ISC), vendored as SVG under ``resources/icons`` rather
than fetched or installed: a field laptop is offline, and an icon set that has
to be downloaded is an icon set that is sometimes missing. The licence sits
beside them.

Every icon here is one 24px-grid Lucide glyph at one stroke weight, so two of
them in the same button are drawn the same. Colour is applied by substituting
the ``currentColor`` the glyphs are drawn with, which is why each is a function
of ``(size, color)`` rather than a file path.

Only two icons are still drawn by hand, and both are data rather than glyphs:
``status_dot_icon`` is a dot in whatever colour an outcome has, and
``section_state_icon`` picks one of these glyphs for a verdict.
