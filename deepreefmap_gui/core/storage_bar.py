"""Where a survey's disk space went, as one button per drive.

The bars sit at the foot of the window for the whole session, so a diver filling
a laptop in the field sees it happening rather than finding out when a run dies.
Only the drives the survey names are drawn: see profiling/volumes.py, which does
all the accounting. This module paints, it does not measure.

Each drive is a button, because seeing the problem and being able to act on it
should not be two different places. Hovering one raises a card with the same
figures at a size somebody can read, and clicking one opens that drive's page.

Colour inside the groove means one thing only: this much of the drive holds
that. Free space is therefore never filled, it is the groove showing through. A
drive that is running out says so in its figures and in an outline around the
whole bar, which cannot be mistaken for one more thing taking up room in it.
