"""The design tokens, and the one place the palette and the global stylesheet are set.

Every colour, radius, spacing step and font size in the app comes from a name here. That is the
whole point: a literal `#4a4` or a bare `padding: 5px` at a call site has drifted off the ramp and
will not move when the ramp does. `apply_theme` then forces Fusion plus a dark palette so the app
looks the same whatever the host OS is doing, which matters because the stylesheets below are
hardcoded dark and a light platform palette shows through everything they do not cover.

Two things about the values are easy to get wrong:

- **The surface ramp is spaced by lightness, not by contrast ratio.** Any two dark greys sit near
  1:1 under WCAG, so a ratio says nothing about whether a card reads as a card. An earlier ramp
  put 13 points of lightness between the shell and a panel, and panels read as text floating on
  the window. `tests/core/test_theme.py` asserts the spacing and the 4.5:1 the accents do owe.
- **Styling a combo or spin box hands arrow drawing to the stylesheet engine**, which then draws
  nothing. Qt stylesheets accept only a URL, so the chevrons are painted into the cache directory
  and referenced from there. Painting needs a live QApplication, which is why the arrow rules are
  appended by `apply_theme` rather than living in the module-level QSS.
