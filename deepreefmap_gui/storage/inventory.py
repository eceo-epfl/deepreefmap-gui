"""Everything the survey put on one drive, in the shape a page can list it.

The storage page answers one question per drive: what is here, and which of it
can go. That splits three ways. Runs are the output directories, each already
tiered by tiers.py. Clips are the footage, which lives wherever it was imported
from and so is filtered by the same volume_root the accounting uses. Everything
else is the residue nobody chose to keep: folders a run died inside before it
wrote a manifest, scene temp files a save left behind, databases an upgrade set
aside.

``classify_mount`` is pure and takes the facts as arguments the way
``group_by_volume`` takes sizes, so a test describes a mount rather than building
one. ``read_mount`` is the gathering half: one scandir of the output root, one
measure per run nobody has measured yet, and no database connection at all,
because it runs on a worker thread and SurveyStore is thread-confined.
