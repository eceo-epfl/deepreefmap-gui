"""The rows the Videos page is a list of: one clip each, and what was cut from it.

Innermost first: a strip painting a clip's sections along its length, a row
describing one clip, a row describing one section, the scrolling list of date
groups those rows sit in, a bare list of one clip's section rows for the detail
pane, and the header row naming the clip columns and sorting them. A clip's
section rows sit directly under it and are shown by its disclosure chevron, so
the three levels the app has (clip, section, run) read as the nesting they are.

The list builds a widget per clip, which suits a field season and would not suit
tens of thousands of them. The escape hatch is a QListView over a model with a
delegate: the strip's paint code moves across unchanged, since it already draws
from a rect and a list of spans rather than from its own children.
