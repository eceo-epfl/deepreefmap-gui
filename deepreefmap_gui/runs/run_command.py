"""The `deepreefmap reconstruct` command line equivalent to a GUI run.

The GUI never shells out: every launch path builds a kwargs dict and calls
``run_reconstruction`` in-process. That leaves no record of what was actually
run, which is exactly what auditing a result or reproducing it elsewhere needs.

This module translates that same kwargs dict into argv, so the command shown to
the user cannot drift from the run it describes. Every flag is emitted even when
it holds its default, so the command doubles as a full settings record — except
for the options in ``_OPTIONAL``, whose only "unset" spelling is omission.

``tests/gui/test_run_command.py`` checks the translation table against the
installed library's Typer signature, so a renamed or added CLI option fails the
suite rather than producing a command that no longer runs.
