"""What the Server page reads, and how it words what went wrong.

Two facts make a connection: a credential, which is per machine, and a position,
which is per survey database. So the address and the device id come from
`sync/credentials.py`, while the pull cursor, the push watermarks and
the time of the last sync come from the database under the output root. Switching
output root switches the position and keeps the credential.

Qt-free: the page only paints what is here.
