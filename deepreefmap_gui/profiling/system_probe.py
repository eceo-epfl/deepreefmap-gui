    The pipeline runs inside this process, so its own footprint is the run's

    and compared later: it charges the run for every other application on the
    desktop, and on a machine with pages already in swap it charged it for those
    too, which made a light mapping backend record a larger peak than a heavy one
    and left the memory grade unable to rank them.

    Off Linux the swap half reads zero, so a run that pages out records low. That
    is the safe direction here rather than a gap: a recorded peak only ever raises
    the estimate's fixed term (memory_estimate.estimate_cost ignores a negative
    shortfall), so an understated reading leaves the model's own figure standing
    instead of talking the machine into a run that will not fit.
