"""How long a session of queued passes will take, before any of it has run.

Each pass is predicted from its own frame count and this machine's learned
per-stage rates, then summed. `RunEtaEstimator` is the engine: given frames,
priors and an expected point count, its remaining time before any progress has
been reported is the sum of every stage's prior estimate.

The ladder below ends in no number rather than an invented one. A machine with
no history for the chosen models has no basis for a figure that would read like
a measurement.

Qt-free, so the prediction can be tested without a window.
