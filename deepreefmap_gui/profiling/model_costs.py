"""What each model costs in memory, per backend and per segmenter.

Two kinds of cost, and the distinction is the whole point of the table:

- Fixed: weights and the working set of one inference step. Constant in the
  number of frames. Segmentation is released before mapping loads
  (orchestrator.py:305), so the peak is the larger stage, never the sum.
- Per frame: memory that accumulates across the sequence. LoGeR detaches every
  window's point maps to CPU and holds them all while torch.cat builds the
  merged copy, so its mapping cost is linear in the whole clip with no cap.

Figures are traced from the pinned pipeline commit and, for segmentation
activations, measured by running each forward pass under a tensor-storage
tracker. Both are approximations; a recorded peak from a real run supersedes
them.
