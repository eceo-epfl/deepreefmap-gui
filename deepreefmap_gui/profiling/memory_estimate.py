"""Whether a run fits in this machine, and if not, what to change.

Peak memory is modelled as a fixed cost plus a per-frame cost, separately for
RAM and VRAM, from the tables in model_costs.py. Both limits are inverted to a
frame ceiling, so the answer to "it does not fit" is a length the machine can
actually process rather than a number the user has to interpret.

Swap counts towards the RAM budget where the machine has it, capped at the
installed RAM again. A run that spills finishes, far more slowly, and refusing
one outright on a machine with 32 GB of swap sitting idle is the wrong answer.
The cap is the honest half: past roughly its own RAM again the working set is
mostly on disk and the run thrashes rather than degrades. Recorded peaks are
already RAM plus the swap the run spilled into (run_history.py), so a budget
without swap graded a measured demand against a pool it was never measured in
and called a run that had succeeded here impossible.

Spilling into swap is not a fault, so it is not a warning: a run that fits the
combined pool grades "ok" and the readout says how much of it runs from swap and
that this is slower. A machine that warns on every run it can actually do is a
machine the user learns to ignore.

The pool is held to what is free as well as to what is installed. A desktop
sitting in 20 GB does not hand it over because a run would like it, and a verdict
graded against the box's figure alone was green on runs that would be killed. The
two are different problems and the wording keeps them apart: the machine being
too small is answered by trimming the pass, another application holding the
memory is answered by closing it.

A Linux RAM exhaustion is an uncatchable OOM kill, so this advises before a long
run rather than crash into it.
